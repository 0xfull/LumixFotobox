Application can remotly control Panasonic Lumix Cameras from Windows 10 devices (PC, Mobile, ... Xbox, Hololens!?)

Application can do no more than original app from Panasonic for Android/iOS. 
While for now app does not support all remote features but Supports features work in a better and faster way. 
And if something is wrong or not enough I can fix it much much faster than Panasonic in their app

App is available in [MS Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NC2W8KC526F)
