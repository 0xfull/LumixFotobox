Application can remotly control Panasonic Lumix Cameras from Windows 10 devices (PC, Mobile, ... Xbox, Hololens!?)

Application can do no more than original app from Panasonic for Android/iOS. 
While for now app does not support all remote features but Supports features work in a better and faster way. 
And if something is wrong or not enough I can fix it much much faster than Panasonic in their app.

App is free and has no ad. You can install it from [MS Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NC2W8KC526F) or from [Project Release page](https://github.com/Rambalac/GMaster/releases/latest)

## Features
* Fullscreen camera liveview. Split screen and new windows for multiple cameras.
* LUT preview. Per camera setting.
* Photo capture and video recording start/stop.
* Change basic parameters like ISO, Aperture, and Shutter. Changes on camera get reflected on the screen in real time.
* Move/resize Autofocus point by mouse or gesture. Real AF area is displayed in real time for Point and Following AF.
* Power Zoom lens zoom and change focus in Manual Focus mode.
* Anamorphic desqueezing (1.33x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x). Per camera setting with option for Anamorphinc Video mode only.
* WiFi manager to autoconnect to camera WiFi access point.
* Multiple cameras can be controlled. You can connect cameras to common access point.
