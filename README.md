Application can remotly control Panasonic Lumix Cameras from Windows 10 devices (PC, Mobile, ... Xbox, Hololens!?)

Application can do no more than original app from Panasonic for Android/iOS. 
While for now app does not support all remote features but Supports features work in a better and faster way. 
And if something is wrong or not enough I can fix it much much faster than Panasonic in their app

App is free and has no ad. You can install it from [MS Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NC2W8KC526F).

## Features
* Fullscreen camera liveview.
* Photo capture and video recording start/stop.
* Change basic parameters like ISO, Aperture, and Shutter. Changes on camera get reflected on the screen in real time.
* Move/resize Autofocus point by mouse or gesture. Real AF area is displayed in real time for Point and Following AF.
* Power Zoom lens zoom and change focus in Manual Focus mode
* Multiple cameras can be controlled. You can connect cameras to common access point.

## Cameras
### Fully supported
* GH4
* GH3

### Other
App may work with other Panasonic Lumix cameras, but I have no way to tested it.

* GX85 - As some people reported App cannot connect.
